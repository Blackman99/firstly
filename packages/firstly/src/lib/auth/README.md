### Lucia adapter

Under the hood, we created a lucia adapter, you can check the code [here](./Adapter.ts) . Feel free
to copy/paste it in your own codebase. You can also suggest improvements here 😉.

By default, all tables/fields will show up in your admin and you are able to extend then with your
own fields.
